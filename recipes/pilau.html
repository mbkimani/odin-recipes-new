    <p>A bowl of East African pilau served with kachumbari</p>

    <p>
      Pilau has a wonderful balance of flavors. It is a festive dish, which is
      never missing during special occasions or events. It’s made with rice
      cooked in a well-seasoned broth of Meat or chicken. Unlike the Indian
      pilau, the East African version does not use curry and it’s less spicy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pilau is delicious on its own and can be served as a stand-alone meal,
      however, if you want a full Kenyan experience simply pair with Kachumbari
      – a cool and refreshing salad made with tomatoes, red onions, cilantro and
      a spicy pepper like serrano chili pepper.

    <h2>Preparation and Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the cumin, coriander, black peppers, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves
        in a dry pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast over low heat until warmed through and fragrant and blend (I used
        a coffee grinder) until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        You need just 1 to 11/2 tablespoons for this recipe (depending on how
        fragrant you want the rice to be). Feel free to store the leftover spice
        powder in an airtight container for up to 3 months, or refrigerate for
        up to 6 months.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat a stockpot on medium-high heat. Add oil and heat until hot but not
        smoking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the sliced onions and fry for 10-15 minutes or till the onions
        starts to turn golden brown (be careful not to burn it).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic, ginger, serrano pepper, Cook for 1-2 minutes, until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cubed beef, pilau masala, beef stock cubes, bay leaves,
        cilantro, and salt to taste. Cook until the meat browns and caramelizes
        stirring occasionally about 8 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced tomatoes and cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomatoes have
        released their liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the potatoes and the water. Bring to a boil and cook for 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the rice, and cover tightly with a foil paper (to keep the steam
        in) if necessary. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 20 minutes, until
        the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the rice is dry, remove the foil paper and fluff with a fork to
        ensure the seasonings are well distributed all around the rice.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot with fresh Kachumbari – salsa. Enjoy!</li>
